# Simple App Plan (Non-Technical)

## App Goal

**One Goal** is a minimal app that helps users focus on a single goal at a time.

No lists.
No systems.
No overwhelm.

Just one goal.
Tracked daily with a simple Yes or No.

---

## What The App Does

* User sets one goal (text)
* The goal is displayed large on screen
* Each day user marks:

  * ✅ Done
  * ❌ Not Done
* App tracks streak
* User can change goal anytime

That’s it.

---

## What It Does NOT Do

* No coaching
* No mental health claims
* No reminders (optional later)
* No advice
* No AI
* No data collection
* No accounts

This keeps Play Store risk extremely low.

---

# Core User Story

> As a user, I open the app, see my one goal clearly, and mark whether I completed it today.

Simple behavior loop. Very powerful psychologically.

---

# App Pages (Minimal Structure)

## 1️⃣ Main Screen (90% of app)

Top:

* Today’s date

Center:

* Goal text (BIG and bold)

Below:

* Two buttons:

  * ✅ Done Today
  * ❌ Not Today

Bottom:

* Current streak 🔥
* “Change Goal” button

If no goal set:

* Big button: “Set Your One Goal”

---

## 2️⃣ Streak / History Page (Optional but Good)

Simple list:

* Date → Yes / No
* Current streak
* Longest streak

Makes it feel complete for review.

---

## 3️⃣ Settings Page

Minimal:

* Reset goal
* Reset streak
* Dark mode toggle
* Privacy Policy
* App version

That’s enough for approval.

---

# MVP Scope (3 Hours Realistic)

### Must Have

* Set one goal
* Display goal
* Daily yes/no tracker
* Streak counter
* Local storage

### Optional If Time Allows

* History list
* Simple animation when streak increases
* Dark mode

---

# Daily Reset Logic (User Experience Level)

Each new day:

* App waits for user input (yes/no)
* If yes → streak +1
* If no → streak resets
* If user skips day → streak resets

Very simple logic.

---

# Why This App Is Strong

* Clear identity
* Minimal but emotional
* Creates attachment through streak
* Feels intentional, not generic

It could grow later into:

* Categories
* Reminders
* Analytics
* Widgets
* Premium themes

But v1 stays tiny.

---

# Play Store Positioning

Use words like:

* “Simple goal tracker”
* “Minimal habit app”
* “Track one goal daily”

Avoid:

* Addiction treatment
* ADHD
* Depression
* “Life changing”
* Medical improvement claims

Keep it productivity-focused.

# Between Your 3 Ideas — Honest Ranking

If goal is fast approval + future growth:

🥇 **One Goal App** (strong identity + scalable)
🥈 3 Tasks Only (very solid, practical)
🥉 Quotes (easiest but less sticky)

---

If you want, I can now:

* Compare **One Goal vs 3 Tasks** strategically
* Write the exact Play Store listing
* Or simplify One Goal even further into a “1-screen only” ultra-MVP

Your move.
